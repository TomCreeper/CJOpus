# CJOpus
Emscripten (C++/JavaScript) bindings for libopus

This module is very experimental. It was initially created as a JavaScript alternative to [`node-opus`](https://github.com/Rantanen/node-opus) for my DiscordApp client library, [`discord.io`](https://github.com/izy521/discord.io). Because of that, a lot of settings are static. However, even though my knowledge of C/C++ is VERY limited, I do plan on making this completely customizable, so if you're a bit more savvy than I am, please submit some PRs!
